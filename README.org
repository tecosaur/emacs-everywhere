A re-implementation of the fantastic idea in [[https://github.com/zachcurry/emacs-anywhere][zachcurry/emacs-anywhere]].

* Installation

Just install from [[https://melpa.org/][MELPA]], and you're ready to go.

** Doom

Available with the =:app everywhere= module (and with a nice modeline).

** Dependencies

On Linux, ensure you have the following dependencies satisfied: =xclip=, =xdotool=, =xprop=, and =xwininfo=.

* Usage

Invoke the Emacs Everywhere executable^{†}.
I recommend doing this by [[*Binding a Shortcut][binding a shortcut]] to:
#+begin_src shell
emacsclient --eval "(emacs-everywhere)"
#+end_src

A new Emacs frame will appear, within which you can type away to your heart's content.
It will remember which window you have focused.

By default, ~emacs-everywhere-insert-selection~ is a hook in
~emacs-everywhere-init-hooks~, and will insert the last text selection into your
new buffer. To clear this, type =DEL= or =C-SPC= /before anything else/.

Once you've finished and want to insert the text into the window you triggered
Emacs Everywhere from, just press =C-c C-c= or =C-x 5 0= to close the frame and
paste the content into the window (as long as ~emacs-everywhere-paste-p~ is
non-nil).

If you do /not/ wish to paste the buffer content into the original window, =C-c
C-k= still copies the content to the clipboard, but never pastes.

-----

^{*†*} This requires the Emacs daemon to be running, but that's super easy.
Just call =emacs --daemon= and you're sorted!

* Binding a Shortcut

Emacs-everywhere needs a way to launch when a not-emacs application has focus. The easiest way to do this is to have a global keybinding/keyboard shortcut dedicated to launching (same as above): ~emacsclient --eval "(emacs-everywhere)"~

On linux/bsd, use your desktop environment, windows manager, or a dedicated processes (like sxhkd, xbindkeys). The [[https://help.ubuntu.com/stable/ubuntu-help/keyboard-shortcuts-set.html.en][ubuntu]] and [[https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Keyboard_shortcuts#Customization][archlinux]] guides are informative.

On MacOS, options include [[http://www.hammerspoon.org/][hammerspoon]], [[https://www.alfredapp.com/help/workflows/triggers/hotkey/][alfred]], [[https://apps.apple.com/us/app/thor-launcher/id1120999687?mt=12][thor]], or [[https://github.com/pqrs-org/Karabiner-Elements/issues/134#issuecomment-439658876][karabiner]]. (Untested, see [[https://github.com/tecosaur/emacs-everywhere/issues/1#issuecomment-781329521][the relevant issue]])

** Example

 For xbindkeys, =~/.xbindkeysrc= would include the entry
 #+begin_src shell
 "emacsclient --eval '(emacs-everywhere)'"
   Alt + Mod4 + e
 #+end_src
